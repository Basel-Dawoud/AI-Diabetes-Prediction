# Diabetes Prediction and Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Challenge! This competition invites participants to explore and apply machine learning techniques to a diabetes dataset, tackling three different types of tasks: regression, classification, and unsupervised learning. Whether you're just starting out or are a seasoned data scientist, this challenge provides a comprehensive platform to showcase your skills across various machine learning paradigms.

## Goal

Your objective is to leverage the diabetes dataset to address the following tasks:

1. **Regression Task**: Predict the Diabetes Pedigree Function based on the diagnostic measurements.
2. **Classification Task**: Classify patients into "high risk" (1) or "low risk" (0) categories based on their diabetes progression.
3. **Unsupervised Learning Task**: Cluster patients based on their baseline medical measurements using unsupervised learning techniques.

Participants will be assessed not only on model accuracy but also on their ability to interpret the data and uncover meaningful patterns.

## How to Get Started

Follow these steps to get started with the competition:

1. **Download the Dataset**: Access the diabetes dataset from the Data tab.
2. **Explore the Data**: Understand the dataset's structure, perform necessary preprocessing, and gain insights into the features.
3. **Tackle Each Task**:
   - **Regression**: Develop a model to predict the Diabetes Pedigree Function.
   - **Classification**: Create a model to classify patients into risk categories based on the Outcome variable.
   - **Clustering**: Apply unsupervised learning methods to discover clusters of patients based on baseline features.

4. **Document Your Work**: Add any tasks and observations to your notebook.
5. **Submit Your Notebook**: Ensure that your notebook includes all necessary code and explanations before submitting it.

## Domain Background

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar (glucose). Proper management of diabetes is essential to prevent serious complications, and machine learning can significantly contribute to predicting and managing the disease. This dataset includes various medical measurements used to predict disease progression and categorize patient risk.

## Tasks Overview

### Regression Task

- **Objective**: Predict the Diabetes Pedigree Function (continuous outcome).
- **Goal**: Model continuous outcomes and understand factors contributing to disease progression.

### Classification Task

- **Objective**: Classify patients as "high risk" or "low risk" based on their medical measurements.
- **Goal**: Identify key factors indicative of high or low risk.

### Unsupervised Learning Task

- **Objective**: Cluster patients based on their baseline medical measurements without using the target variable.
- **Goal**: Uncover hidden patterns and patient segments within the data.

## Technical Details

### Data

The dataset consists of several medical features including:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration measured during a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (kg/mÂ²)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Outcome**: Binary target variable indicating diabetes presence (1) or absence (0)

### Formatting Guidelines

- **File Naming**: Name your submission files according to the task (e.g., `regression_submission.csv`, `classification_submission.csv`, `clustering_submission.csv`).
- **Submission Limits**: You may submit up to 1 time per day for each task. Only your best submission will be considered for the leaderboard.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that Id values in your submissions match those in the test dataset.
- **File Format**: Submissions must be in CSV format with the specified column names and order.

## Evaluation

### Regression Task

- **Metric**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Explanation**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. Lower MSE indicates better performance.

### Classification Task

- **Metric**: Accuracy and ROC-AUC
- **Explanation**: Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions, while ROC-AUC evaluates classification quality considering true positive and false positive rates.

### Unsupervised Learning Task

- **Metric**: Silhouette Score
- **Explanation**: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. Higher scores indicate better-defined clusters.

## Good Luck!
